# BengaliLexicalDisambiguationGoldStandard

This repository contains information about Gold Standard (GS) dataset preparation for Bengali Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in SemEval 2013 WSD task-12 XML format.

I prepared this GS dataset for the evaluation of Bengali WSD system. Here, Bengali WordNet (Dash, Niladri Sekhar 2011) used as a lexical resource.

I would like to share this dataset with the community.


Cheers,

Mohammad Nasiruddin
